                                 πmenu

πmenu is a pie menu utility for X.
πmenu receives a menu specification in stdin, shows a menu for the user
to select one of the options, and outputs the option selected to stdout.
πmenu can be controlled both via mouse and via keyboard.  The menu is a
pop-up menu (that is, after selecting an option, the menu disappears).

This is a experimental project based on xmenu.


§ Features

πmenu comes with the following features:
• πmenu reads something in and prints something out, the UNIX way.
• Submenus (some menu entries can spawn another menu).
• Separators (menu entries can be separated by a line).
• Icons (menu entries can be preceded by an icon image).


§ Files

The files are:
• ./README:     This file.
• ./Makefile:   The makefile.
• ./config.h:   The hardcoded default configuration for πmenu.
• ./config.mk:  The setup for the makefile.
• ./demo.gif:   A gif demonstrating how πmenu works.
• ./xmenu.1:    The manual file (man page) for πmenu.
• ./xmenu.c:    The source code of πmenu.
• ./xmenu.sh:   A sample script illustrating how to use πmenu.
• ./icons/:     Icons for the sample script


§ Installation

First, edit ./config.mk to match your local setup.

In order to build πmenu you need the Imlib2, Xlib and Xft header files.
The default configuration for πmenu is specified in the file config.h,
you can edit it, but most configuration can be changed at runtime via
X resources.  Enter the following command to build πmenu.  This command
creates the binary file ./xmenu.

	make

By default, πmenu is installed into the /usr/local prefix.  Enter the
following command to install πmenu (if necessary as root).  This command
installs the binary file ./xmenu into the ${PREFIX}/bin/ directory, and
the manual file ./xmenu.1 into ${MANPREFIX}/man1/ directory.

	make install


§ Running πmenu

πmenu receives as input a menu specification where each line is a menu
entry.  Each line can be indented with tabs to represent nested menus.
Each line is made out of a label and a command separated by any number
of tabs.  Lines without labels are menu separators.

See the script ./xmenu.sh for an example of how to use πmenu to draw a
simple menu with submenus and separators.  The file ./demo.gif shows how
the menu generated by that script looks like.

Read the manual for more information on running πmenu.
